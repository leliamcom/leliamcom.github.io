The benchmark script and how to setup is at [this Github Repo](https://github.com/nghenglim/database_benchmark).\n\n## Notice & FAQ\n- Why using default database configuration / configuration between databases is difference:\n  - This benchmark is using default configuration that comes with the docker image.\n  - Time consuming to standardize databases configuration\n  - Default configuration should give a basic idea on how the database performs.\n- Why missing benchmark on index, included data transfer time for benchmark, etc:\n  - Is in the To Do list, however IMHO these are good to have benchmark.\n  - Preferably others can help to enhance the [script](https://github.com/nghenglim/database_benchmark).\n- Why run in VM which make this benchmark not so reliable:\n  - Do not want to spend money to buy a physical server or cloud instances.\n  - Make benchmark decentralized, everyone who had a laptop should be able to do their own benchmark instead of relying on others.\n  - A rough idea on how these databases perform is very important knowledge for all the developer.\n\n## Benchmark Environment (Vagrant)\n- Ubuntu wily werewolf (15.10)\n- 1 core CPU, 100% execution cap\n- 1024 MB memory\n\n## Benchmark Environment (Docker)\n- mariadb:10.1.11\n- mysql:5.7.10\n- postgres:9.5.0\n\n## Benchmark Details\nFull detail is at [this Github Repo Folder](https://github.com/nghenglim/database_benchmark/tree/master/Mariadb10.1.11-MySQL5.7.10-Postgres9.5.0)\n\nTotal Rows: 1 million\n\nQueries:\n\n1. `SELECT * FROM testing LIMIT 1000`\n2. `SELECT * FROM testing WHERE int_col > 5000 LIMIT 1000`\n3. `SELECT * FROM testing WHERE int_col + int_col2 > 12345`\n4. `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM testing WHERE int_col + int_col2 > 12345`\n5. `SELECT * FROM testing WHERE int_col > 5000 ORDER BY word_col ASC LIMIT 1000`\n6. `SELECT * FROM testing WHERE word_col LIKE '%lim%' ORDER BY word_col DESC LIMIT 1000`\n\nMariaDB Summary:\n\n~~~\naverage write time: 50.02ms/10000rows\naverage query time (q1): 3.87ms\naverage query time (q2): 4.36ms\naverage query time (q3): 5.18ms\naverage query time (q4): 261.69ms\naverage query time (q5): 741.55ms\naverage query time (q6): 639.75ms\n~~~\n\nMySQL Summary:\n\n~~~\naverage write time: 50.86ms/10000rows\naverage query time (q1): 3.42ms\naverage query time (q2): 3.91ms\naverage query time (q3): 5.33ms\naverage query time (q4): 246.77ms\naverage query time (q5): 6686.11ms\naverage query time (q6): 508.9ms\n~~~\n\nPostgreSQL Summary:\n\n~~~\naverage write time: 79.2ms/10000rows\naverage query time (q1): 3.27ms\naverage query time (q2): 3.62ms\naverage query time (q3): 4.0ms\naverage query time (q4): 169.18ms\naverage query time (q5): 229.33ms\naverage query time (q6): 207.01ms\n~~~\n\n## Conclusion\n- MariabDB & MySQL has slight advantages at database writing\n- PostgreSQL has slight advantages at simple database read query\n- PostgreSQL has big advantages at complex database read query\n\nAs a result, I think that choosing PostgreSQL is a better options for RDBMS - provided that PostgreSQL comes with more features and following standard SQL.\n    ","description":"\nOn Dec 2015 I have done a similar [benchmark on postgres vs mariadb vs mysql](https://www.leliam.com/postgresql-vs-mariadb-mysql-2015), however I had done some serious mistake on the benchmark and caused the result to be biased towards MySQL.\n\nTherefore I had enhanced the benchmark.

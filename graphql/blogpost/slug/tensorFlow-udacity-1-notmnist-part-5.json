Besides, it also let us know on sklearn - a python machine library - so that we can then compare with TensorFlow. This is the exact [ipynb file at Tensorflow Github Repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb).\n\n## Notice\nThis is as a form of sharing and discuss on better way to solve 1_notmnist problem. Do not copy and paste directly as it does not help on improving yourself + the answer is not optimized.\n\nThe entire series of TensorFlow Udacity can be found at [here](http://nghenglim.github.io/tags/#TensorFlow-Udacity-ref)\n\n\n## Solving Problem 5\n~~~python\ndef reshape(a):\n    return a.reshape(a.shape[0],a.shape[1]*a.shape[2])\nt = pickle.load(open(\"notMNIST.pickle\", \"r\"))\nunique_td = unique_rows(reshape(t['train_dataset']))\nduplicate_rows = len(t['train_dataset']) - len(unique_td)\nprint(duplicate_rows)\n~~~\n![png](http://localhost:9000/nghenglim-public/2016041600.png)\n\n## Comment\nStill got 2 optional question that I have not yet answered.

It comes with `lb-ng` tools which auto generate angular service which you might find it handy.\n- Backend: Build in swagger support, switchable database at model level and easy-to-create script such as database migration.\n\n## Advantage Of Loopback\n- [Well Documented](https://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/LoopBack), including Android SDK, iOS SDK and Xamarin SDK.\n- IBM and the StrongLoop team are committed to maintaining and improving the LoopBack open-source project\n\n## Disadvantage Of Loopback\n- No first class support of promise yet - as in discussed in this [thread](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/issues/418)\n- Postgres datasource is still lack of some feature - might have to write raw query to get the job done.\n- Rumor is Google is ditching Angular 1. Therefore there could be a hard time to upgrade to Angular 2 for Loopback.\n\n## Words of Thought\nRecently I have been using Loopback a lot in my web project or as mobile application's backend server. Personally I think it is the best NodeJS framework among those I had tried - expressJS, sailsJS and meteorJs.\n\nIf you are choosing a NodeJS framework for your new project, you might as well give it a try!\n    ","id":"22c9a706-5930-48cf-a261-7fc21322989e","bannerUrl":"/assets/2016070900.png","coverUrl":"/assets/2016070900.png","postedAt":"2016-07-08T16:00:00.000Z","tags":["nodejs"],"title":"Loopback for NodeJS","typeCode":1}

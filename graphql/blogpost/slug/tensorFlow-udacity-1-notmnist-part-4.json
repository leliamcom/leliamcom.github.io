Besides, it also let us know on sklearn - a python machine library - so that we can then compare with TensorFlow. This is the exact [ipynb file at Tensorflow Github Repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb).\n\n## Notice\nThis is as a form of sharing and discuss on better way to solve 1_notmnist problem. Do not copy and paste directly as it does not help on improving yourself + the answer is not optimized.\n\nThe entire series of TensorFlow Udacity can be found at [here](http://nghenglim.github.io/tags/#TensorFlow-Udacity-ref)\n\n\n## Solving Problem 4\n~~~python\nprint(np.unique(train_labels))\nprint(np.unique(test_labels))\nprint(np.bincount(train_labels))\nprint(np.bincount(test_labels))\n~~~\n![png](http://localhost:9000/nghenglim-public/2016040900.png)\n\n## Comment\nSince after shuffling, the image for each count for each train_labels and test_labels is the same, therefore we can say that the data is still good after shuffling!\n    ","description":"\nBasically 1_notmnist is to learn how to display data in Jupyter Notebook.

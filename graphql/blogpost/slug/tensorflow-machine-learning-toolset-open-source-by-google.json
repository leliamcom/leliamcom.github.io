As a programmer that is passionate towards AI, this is a thing that I must try out.\n\n## Setup\nFYI, setup instruction can be found at [here](www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup.md).\n\n## Tensorflow with mnist\n\nPut the file at `/home/vagrant/notebook/`\n\n- Download [fully_connected_feed.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/mnist/fully_connected_feed.py)\n  - replace `from tensorflow.g3doc.tutorials.mnist import input_data` to `import input_data`\n  - replace `from tensorflow.g3doc.tutorials.mnist import input_data` to `import mnist`\n- Download [input_data.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/mnist/input_data.py)\n- Download [mnist.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/mnist/mnist.py)\n\nExecute `python fully_connected_feed.py`, it should run and give you the result like this\n\n~~~\nStep 1000: loss = 0.40 (0.007 sec)\nStep 1100: loss = 0.52 (0.087 sec)\nStep 1200: loss = 0.46 (0.005 sec)\nStep 1300: loss = 0.49 (0.005 sec)\nStep 1400: loss = 0.48 (0.006 sec)\nStep 1500: loss = 0.37 (0.029 sec)\nStep 1600: loss = 0.45 (0.005 sec)\nStep 1700: loss = 0.40 (0.005 sec)\nStep 1800: loss = 0.39 (0.005 sec)\nStep 1900: loss = 0.44 (0.006 sec)\nTraining Data Eval:\n  Num examples: 55000  Num correct: 49219  Precision @ 1: 0.8949\nValidation Data Eval:\n  Num examples: 5000  Num correct: 4508  Precision @ 1: 0.9016\nTest Data Eval:\n  Num examples: 10000  Num correct: 8978  Precision @ 1: 0.8978\n~~~\n\n## Graph visualization\n\nNow run `tensorboard --logdir=/home/vagrant/notebook/data`, open browser at localhost:6006 to view the graph. You should be able to see something like this:\n\n![tensorboard](http://localhost:9000/nghenglim-public/2015111401.png \"tensorboard\")\n\n## My Review\n\nNot really standout from torch/caffe/etc, I thought it has the ability to drag and drop modify code like Pentaho, however it only has the ability to view the summary graph.\n\n- Overall - Good to use.\n- Surprising me? Not.\n    ","description":"\nOn 10th November, I saw the news that [Google open sourced Tensorflow](http://www.wired.com/2015/11/google-open-sources-its-artificial-intelligence-engine/?mbid=social_fb).

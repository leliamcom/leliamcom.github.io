Besides, it also let us know on sklearn - a python machine library - so that we can then compare with TensorFlow. This is the exact [ipynb file at Tensorflow Github Repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb).\n\n## Notice\nThis is as a form of sharing and discuss on better way to solve 1_notmnist problem. Do not copy and paste directly as it does not help on improving yourself + the answer is not optimized.\n\nThe entire series of TensorFlow Udacity can be found at [tensorflow-udacity tag](https://www.leliam.com/tag/tensorflow-udacity)\n\n\n## Solving Problem 2\n~~~python\n# first load the pickle file, loading one for illustration purpose\nt = pickle.load(open(\"notMNIST_large/A.pickle\", \"r\"))\n# need to use matplotlib inline if want to show at jupyter Notebook\n%matplotlib inline\n# plot one of image. the number 5 to be exactly\nplt.imshow(t[4], interpolation='nearest')\n# show the image\nplt.show()\n~~~\n![png](http://localhost:9000/nghenglim-public/2016032600.png)\n    ","description":"\nBasically 1_notmnist is to learn how to display data in Jupyter Notebook.

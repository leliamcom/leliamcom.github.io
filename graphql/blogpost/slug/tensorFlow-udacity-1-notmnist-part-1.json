Besides, it also let us know on sklearn - a python machine library - so that we can then compare with TensorFlow. This is the exact [ipynb file at Tensorflow Github Repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb).\n\n## Notice\nThis is as a form of sharing and discuss on better way to solve 1_notmnist problem. Do not copy and paste directly as it does not help on improving yourself + the answer is not optimized.\n\nThe entire series of TensorFlow Udacity can be found at [here](http://nghenglim.github.io/tags/#TensorFlow-Udacity-ref)\n\n## Preparation\n~~~bash\n# start a docker container\ndocker run -p 8888:8888 -it b.gcr.io/tensorflow-udacity/assignments:latest\n~~~\n\n>## Problem 1\n>Let's take a peek at some of the data to make sure it looks sensible. Each exemplar should be an image of a character A through J rendered in a different >font. Display a sample of the images that we just downloaded. Hint: you can use the package IPython.display.\n\n## Solving Problem 1\n~~~python\nimport os, random\ndir_name = \"notMNIST_large\"\nfolder_names = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", \"I\", \"J\"]\nfor folder in folder_names:\n  im_name = random.choice(os.listdir(dir_name + \"/\" + folder))\n  im_file = dir_name + \"/\" + folder + \"/\" + im_name\n  display(Image(filename=im_file))\n~~~\n![png](http://localhost:9000/nghenglim-public/2016031901.png)\n\n## Comment\nBefore I get to Problem 1 I have spent a lot of time download the notMNIST_large due to low RAM I have given to my VM that run the docker container.\n\nFor the problem part, it teaches us on using `display(Image(filename=im_file))` which is a very useful function of showing image file on Jupyter Notebook.\n    ","id":"7770fddb-b53f-4590-9737-50d4c194d55d","bannerUrl":"/assets/2016031900.png","coverUrl":"/assets/2016031900.png","postedAt":"2016-03-18T16:00:00.000Z","tags":["machine-learning","tensorflow-udacity"],"title":"TensorFlow Udacity 1_notmnist - Part 1","typeCode":1}

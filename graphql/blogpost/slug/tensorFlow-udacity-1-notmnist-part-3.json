Besides, it also let us know on sklearn - a python machine library - so that we can then compare with TensorFlow. This is the exact [ipynb file at Tensorflow Github Repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb).\n\n## Notice\nThis is as a form of sharing and discuss on better way to solve 1_notmnist problem. Do not copy and paste directly as it does not help on improving yourself + the answer is not optimized.\n\nThe entire series of TensorFlow Udacity can be found at [here](http://nghenglim.github.io/tags/#TensorFlow-Udacity-ref)\n\n\n## Solving Problem 3\n~~~python\nlen_dict = {}\nfor folder in folder_names:\n    t = pickle.load(open(dir_name + \"/\" + folder + \".pickle\", \"r\"))\n    len_dict[folder] = len(t)\nprint(len_dict)\n~~~\n![png](http://localhost:9000/nghenglim-public/2016040200.png)\n\n## Comment\nSince the image for each class is roughly around 52911, therefore we can say that the data is balanced. Though more appropiate way is to calculate the standard deviation :)\n    ","id":"b0f673c7-1695-44b2-8f18-35ac5fd2ada0","bannerUrl":"/assets/2016031900.png","coverUrl":"/assets/2016031900.png","postedAt":"2016-04-01T16:00:00.000Z","tags":["machine-learning","tensorflow-udacity"],"title":"TensorFlow Udacity 1_notmnist - Part 3","typeCode":1}

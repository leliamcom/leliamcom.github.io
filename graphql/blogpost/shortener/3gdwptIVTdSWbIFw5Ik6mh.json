A demo can be found at [http://nodejslim.herokuapp.com/](http://nodejslim.herokuapp.com)\n\n## MEAN Stack\n\nMEAN stack is a software bundle with [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/),\n[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).\n\n## What this Repo do.\n\n- It uses Node.js -- a web server that use a event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.\n- To make use of this non blocking attributes, we use an asynchronous non-blocking nosql database MongoDB.\n  - FYI, mysql and postgresql still have no good asynchronous support at this point of time.\n  - As a real time chat system, it has to store many data, a relational database will be too hard to scale and also to partition it easily.\n- To setup this server quickly while maintaining a good architecture, we use express as a web framework for Node.js.\n- For the frontend, we use AngularJS as Javascript MVC framework. Everything will serve restfully from Node.js to AngularJS.\n\n## Some comment\n\n- Node.JS is using ECMAScript 5(current javascript syntax), therefore the code is not so clean. With the future ECMAScript 6 become mainstream,\nI believe that it will be easier to code for nodeJS.\n- Need to make sure everything is asynchronous, and use promise when needed.\n        ","description":"\nWhat I am going to write about is a real time chat proof of concept which I have done in 2014.

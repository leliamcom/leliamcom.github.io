The course consists of six weekly hands-on projects that take you from constructing elementary\nlogic gates all the way to building a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn -- in the most direct and intimate way -- how\ncomputers work, and how they are designed.\n\n## Rating\n\nI think this course is great for programmer with no electrical engineering background. After taking this course, now when I do coding, I can imagine the background\nprocess done by the laptop -- logic gates, ALU, RAM, BUSES, machine language and the assembly language.\n\n## Notes\n\n- I did not do the assignment of this course, as it needs to install a software that chrome thinks that it is harmful.\n- This course require no hardware to start, it uses a software program to simulate and to write a logic gate. From the logic gates we build a 16 bits pc.\n  - Nowadays, we are building a computer from a computer.\n- There are no part 2 yet, the book \"From Nand to Tetris\" should contain from assembly to tetris part.\n    ","description":"\nBuild a modern computer system, starting from first principles.

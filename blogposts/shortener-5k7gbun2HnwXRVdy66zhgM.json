For me,\nI just have to download exe installer to execute in Windows.</p>\n<h2>The UI</h2>\n<p>The default UI is quite similar with sublime text. Those who comes from sublime\ntext will be pretty happy with it.</p>\n<h2>Initialize time</h2>\n<p>The initialize time is slower than nodepad++ and sublime text, however its\nfaster than eclipse.</p>\n<h2>Default Package</h2>\n<p>It comes with lots of nice packages as default. For example PHP, git source control\nand etc. It also comes with spell checking, word autocomplete for writing normal\nblog post. It has increase my productivity when writing small project or blog\npost.</p>\n<h2>Package that currently lack of</h2>\n<p>For coding for PHP application in my daily professional job, it is lacking the\nfunctionality of code navigation. This is due to when working on a PHP application\nthat is manage by a big team, the code base is really large and code navigation\nlargely increase the productivity. Eclipse do well in this part, it just has to\nCtrl + click the class, normally it will navigate to the correct file.</p>\n<h2>Overall feeling</h2>\n<p>For me, its worth to install atom. It makes me feel pro to write my blog post in\natom than in nodepad++.</p>\n","postedAt":"18 Jul, 2015","metaDescription":"It comes with lots of nice packages as default.

And I have done react native before, so I will like to try out Flutter this time!</p>\n<h2>Overall Experience</h2>\n<p>I'm developing with flutter 1.22 and I will say the document is quite good! Mostly due to it has been around for quite some time!</p>\n<p>The only downside is it is using dart, which is not so common language. However it can be advantage too - Dart is type safe, unlike react native most example is using javascript, and while introduce type checking to react native, the compilation speed will increase by quite a lot.</p>\n<h2>Some holes stepped into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>I am using <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications\">flutter local notifications</a>, the notification is not being rescheduled once quick restart, luckily flutter plugin not so complicated and have fixed and <a href=\"https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/pull/850\">pr merged for version 2.0.1</a>.</li>\n<li>Have been using <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction\">integration testing</a> to take screenshot + test, however currently the flutter test driver cannot integrate with native permission popup, currently I just add default permission to both android and iOS to bypass as workaround.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Last but not least</h2>\n<p>For those who are not single and want to record important moment with your girlfriend/boyfriend, kindly download this Ads free app at <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.leliam.daywithyou\">google playstore</a>.</p>\n<p>Rating and feedback is appreciated. There will be more updates coming in.</p>\n","postedAt":"14 Oct, 2020","metaDescription":"Up until recently I finally have an idea and motivation to create a cross-platform app to record moments and reminding important days between couple.\nTherefore, its the best timing for me to explore the cool kid Flutter for iOS + android development.Its already in google playstore, iOS appstore still trying to get approved.\n"}

Everything will serve restfully from Node.js to AngularJS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Some comment</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Node.JS is using ECMAScript 5(current javascript syntax), therefore the code is not so clean. With the future ECMAScript 6 become mainstream,\nI believe that it will be easier to code for nodeJS.</li>\n<li>Need to make sure everything is asynchronous, and use promise when needed.</li>\n</ul>\n","postedAt":"27 Jun, 2015","metaDescription":"What I am going to write about is a real time chat proof of concept which I have done in 2014.

AlphaGo is a computer program developed by Google DeepMind in London to play the board game Go. In October 2015, it became the first computer Go program to beat a professional human Go player without handicaps on a full-sized 19×19 board. In March 2016, it beat Lee Sedol in the first three games in a five-game match, the first time a computer Go program has beaten a 9-dan professional without handicaps.
AlphaGo's algorithm uses a combination of machine learning and tree search techniques, combined with extensive training, both from human and computer play.

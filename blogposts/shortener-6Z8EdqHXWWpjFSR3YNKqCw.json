The course consists of six weekly hands-on projects that take you from constructing elementary\nlogic gates all the way to building a fully functioning general purpose computer.

After taking this course, now when I do coding, I can imagine the background\nprocess done by the laptop -- logic gates, ALU, RAM, BUSES, machine language and the assembly language.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I did not do the assignment of this course, as it needs to install a software that chrome thinks that it is harmful.</li>\n<li>This course require no hardware to start, it uses a software program to simulate and to write a logic gate. From the logic gates we build a 16 bits pc.\n<ul>\n<li>Nowadays, we are building a computer from a computer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are no part 2 yet, the book &quot;From Nand to Tetris&quot; should contain from assembly to tetris part.</li>\n</ul>\n","postedAt":"30 May, 2015","metaDescription":"Build a modern computer system, starting from first principles.

Asymptotic analysis including big-oh notation.  Divide-and-conquer algorithms for sorting, counting inversions, matrix multiplication, and closest pair.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Week 2: Running time analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms.  The master method.  Introduction to randomized algorithms, with a probability review.  QuickSort.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Week 3: More on randomized algorithms and probability.  Computing the median in linear time.  A randomized algorithm for the minimum graph cut problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Week 4: Graph primitives.  Depth- and breadth-first search.  Connected components in undirected graphs.  Topological sort in directed acyclic graphs.  Strongly connected components in directed graphs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Week 5: Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm.  Introduction to data structures.  Heaps and applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Week 6: Further data structures.  Hash tables and applications.  Balanced binary search trees</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Comments On The Course</h2>\n<p>Quite like this course as I have not take standard algorithm course in my university. In this course, I've learn how the algorithm works and its theory.</p>\n<p>The course coding assignment is not bad though. I've been using python to solve this 6 week code assignment.</p>\n<p>About the lecture, its not quite easy to understand without some programming background. Even I listen to the course, I also have to wiki or stackoverflow to know more about the lecture material.</p>\n<p>Today is week 6 for this course, therefore the statement of accomplishment should be coming out in the coming few weeks. This is what I like for stanford university also. Usually their course will provide a statement of accomplishment during the end of the course.</p>\n<p>Overall, I'll give a 4 out of 5 star rating to this course.</p>\n","postedAt":"08 Aug, 2015","metaDescription":"Quite like this course as I have not take standard algorithm course in my university.

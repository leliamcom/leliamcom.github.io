FYI, Lubuntu is a light weight version of Ubuntu. Using Lubuntu, you can have more control on your PC.</p>\n<h2>Advantage for replacing Windows for Lubuntu</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Combination of Windows 7 with command line feeling</li>\n<li>Directly use docker container to run application instead of virtualbox, which provide a higher speed.</li>\n<li>Faster speed for most of the program, for example android-studio. This might be due to less backend application run in Windows (And it is hard to disable those application).</li>\n<li>More control on the system and more debug message can be seen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Disadvantage for using Lubuntu</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Most gaming software run natively in windows, the worst things is I have installed lubuntu xenial 16.04LTS version and they have dropped support for my AMD RADEON graphic card model,</li>\n<li>The UI is not as beautiful as Windows</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Some bug Fix</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix no sound</li>\n</ul>\n<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>install restrict-ubuntu\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix frequent crash in dell inspiron graphic card: upgrade from kernel 4.4 to kernel 4.6</li>\n<li>Local Support: go to start &gt; Preferences &gt; Language Support</li>\n<li>Unable to start docker: sudo docker daemon -D -s vfs</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Some example</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Run this blog locally</li>\n</ul>\n<pre class=\"hljs\"><code><span class=\"hljs-built_in\">cd</span> /e/nghenglim.github.io/ <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># contain the repo</span>\nsudo docker run -d -v <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"<span class=\"hljs-variable\">$PWD</span>:/src\"</span> -p 4000:4000 grahamc/jekyll serve -H 0.0.0.0\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If graphic card is not supported by Lubuntu, the best setup will be dual boot Lubuntu and Windows. Play games and watch movie in Windows, however do development in Lubuntu.</p>\n","postedAt":"11 Jun, 2016","metaDescription":"As a developer, you must have heard of ubuntu.

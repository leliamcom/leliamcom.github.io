Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis.

Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.</p> <h2>Evaluation</h2> <p>Submissions are evaluated one the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). The RMSLE is calculated as</p> <p><img alt="Bike sharing demand evaluation" loading=lazy src=/assets/2015060501.png title="bike sharing demand evaluation"></p> <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>n is the number of hours in the test set</li> <li>pi is your predicted count</li> <li>ai is the actual count</li> <li>log(x) is the natural logarithm</li> </ul> <h2>Method</h2> <p>Data preprocess with python.

During the process of competing, I have improved quite a lot. This is my first kaggle competition, and is not the last. I am currently working on the challenge with prize pool. Hope will have a good result with state of the art machine learning technique - deep learning.</p> <p>Its quite interesting working in kaggle project as I am competing with the world data scientist.

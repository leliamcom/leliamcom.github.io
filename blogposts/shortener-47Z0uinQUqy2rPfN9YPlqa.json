A well known example is doing image convolution with CUDA. However GPU is mainly for graphic processing but not machine learning, therefore it is not functioning to the optimal.</p>\n<p>And IMO this is the reason google releasing TPU. TPU will be optimized for doing machine learning training, and I foresee  it will come with first class support with Tensorflow.</p>\n<h2>Forecasting</h2>\n<p>Google is aiming big for the A.I., and TPU is one of the strategy to make them stay in the main stream. And this is also a symbolic of that maker spirit is on the rise - traditionally it would be asking vendor such as Intel to produce these things</p>\n","postedAt":"20 May, 2016","metaDescription":"If you have seen the Google's I/O 2016, you might have known about Google Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU.\n"}

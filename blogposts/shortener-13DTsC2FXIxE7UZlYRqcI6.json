It comes with <code>lb-ng</code> tools which auto generate angular service which you might find it handy.</li>\n<li>Backend: Build in swagger support, switchable database at model level and easy-to-create script such as database migration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Advantage Of Loopback</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/LoopBack\">Well Documented</a>, including Android SDK, iOS SDK and Xamarin SDK.</li>\n<li>IBM and the StrongLoop team are committed to maintaining and improving the LoopBack open-source project</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Disadvantage Of Loopback</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>No first class support of promise yet - as in discussed in this <a href=\"https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/issues/418\">thread</a></li>\n<li>Postgres datasource is still lack of some feature - might have to write raw query to get the job done.</li>\n<li>Rumor is Google is ditching Angular 1. Therefore there could be a hard time to upgrade to Angular 2 for Loopback.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Words of Thought</h2>\n<p>Recently I have been using Loopback a lot in my web project or as mobile application's backend server. Personally I think it is the best NodeJS framework among those I had tried - expressJS, sailsJS and meteorJs.</p>\n<p>If you are choosing a NodeJS framework for your new project, you might as well give it a try!</p>\n","postedAt":"09 Jul, 2016","metaDescription":"In a nutshell, loopback is a NodeJS framework for building rest API server\nEdit on year Jun 19, 2018\nCurrently favor Koa2 more for NodeJS\n"}

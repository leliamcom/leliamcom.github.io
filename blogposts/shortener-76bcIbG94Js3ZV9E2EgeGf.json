This course takes\nApproximately 3 months with assumption 6hrs/wk (work at your own pace).</p>\n<h2>Knowledge Needed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Python (using jupyter notebook)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Assumption On Achievement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Good at using Tensorflow: which should be the main reason google had built this course, to promote their open source machine learning framework. IMHO, Tensorflow really lack of documentation/example due to its age.</li>\n<li>More deep learning knowledge: Andrew Ng Machine Learning course only slightly covered neural network, I do hope can learn something new about deep learning here</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Syllabus</h2>\n<p>This course consist of four Lessons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lesson 1: From Machine Learning to Deep Learning</li>\n<li>Lesson 2: Deep Neural Networks</li>\n<li>Lesson 3: Convolutional Neural Networks</li>\n<li>Lesson 4: Deep Models for Text and Sequences</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>So far on Lessons 1</h2>\n<p>Nothings new if you had attended other machine learning course. Basicly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prepare your Docker environment which consist of Course Materials with Jupyter Notebook for the future Lesson</li>\n<li>Walkthrough on basic machine learning rules such as learning rate, overfitting, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Comment</h2>\n<p>This is really a course that machine learning guys shouldn't miss. Deep learning is the state of the art machine learning technique which has been used to solve many real world problem.</p>\n<p>You probably know that AlphaGo - which is mainly written in deep learning - has beaten the three-time European Go champion Fan Hui 5â€“0.</p>\n","postedAt":"07 Feb, 2016","metaDescription":"FYI, the course link is https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730.
